# Kaggle Competition: Mathematical Problem Classification

Welcome to my project on Mathematical Problem Classification! I participated in a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/math-problem-categorization). In this competition, our goal was to classify mathematical problems into different categories, such as algebra, calculus, geometry, and more, based on their descriptions. We leveraged deep learning frameworks like LSTM and RNN to tackle this problem.

## Competition Overview

The Kaggle competition focused on developing a model that could accurately classify mathematical problems into their respective categories. Participants were provided with a large dataset of mathematical problem descriptions, each accompanied by its corresponding category label. The challenge was to build a robust model that could learn the underlying patterns and structures within the problem descriptions to make accurate predictions.

## Approach and Techniques

To solve the problem, we employed deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). These architectures are well-suited for sequential data processing, making them ideal for capturing the sequential nature of mathematical problem descriptions. By leveraging the strengths of LSTM and RNN, our model was able to understand the context and dependencies within the problem statements, enabling accurate classification.

## Model Training and Evaluation

During the competition, we split the provided dataset into training and validation sets to train and evaluate our model. We implemented the LSTM and RNN architectures using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow. Through an iterative process, we fine-tuned the model's hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, hidden units, and learning rate, to optimize performance.

To measure the effectiveness of our model, we employed evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics allowed us to assess the model's ability to correctly classify mathematical problems into their respective categories. The rigorous evaluation process helped us refine our approach and improve the model's performance over time.

## Results and Achievements

After intense competition, our model demonstrated impressive performance, securing the 4th position in the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/math-problem-categorization). By effectively leveraging LSTM and RNN, we were able to accurately classify mathematical problems into their appropriate categories. Our achievement highlights the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in solving complex classification problems, even in the domain of mathematics.

## Future Work and Contributions

While the competition has concluded, the project's journey doesn't end here. We believe there are further opportunities to enhance the model's performance and explore additional techniques. We are open to collaborations and contributions from the community to expand and refine the mathematical problem classification model.

## Conclusion

Participating in the [Kaggle competition](https://example.com/kaggle-competition) on mathematical problem classification has been a rewarding experience. By applying LSTM, RNN, and deep learning methodologies, we successfully tackled the challenge of categorizing mathematical problems based on their descriptions. We are excited to continue exploring and advancing the field of problem classification in the realm of mathematics.
